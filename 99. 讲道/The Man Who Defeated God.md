**I. From Confidence to Desperation (5 minutes)**

### Two Sons, Two Ways of Life

Let me briefly introduce Jacob.

Isaac had twin sons: **Esau** and **Jacob**.

Esau's name means "hairy," or "red " but I think he should be called "**Mr. It-Doesn't-Matter**"—because he sold his birthright for a bowl of lentil soup. God's promise and blessing didn't matter to him.

Jacob's name means "grasper" or "supplanter," but I think he should be called "**Mr. Self-Reliant**"—because he constantly used human schemes to achieve his goals: deceiving his brother out of the birthright, deceiving his father out of the blessing.

**Two Moments, Twenty Years Apart**

After stealing the blessing, Jacob had to flee. His brother wanted to kill him.

On the road at **Bethel****（****Temple of God)**, God appeared to him with an incredible promise: "I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go."

But listen to Jacob's response: "**If** God will be with me... and give me food and clothes... **then** the Lord will be my God" (Genesis 28:20-22).

Hear that? A **conditional** statement. "If you bless me, then I'll worship you."

At this point, though Jacob had nothing besides a stick to walk with, **he still believed in himself**, confident.

---

Twenty years later, Jacob wealthy, married, lots of kids. God told him to go home. But there was a problem: Esau, whom he had deceived, was still there—and was coming to meet him **with four hundred men**.

Now Jacob completely panicked:

- Divided his family into groups for escape
- Sent wave after wave of gifts ahead
- Prayed desperately: "Save me from the hand of my brother!" (Beautiful prayer)
- Sent everyone across the river, **but stayed alone on the other side**

Why didn't he cross? Because he was terrified. He needed God's "seal of approval"(Promise) before he dared face his brother.

---

Compare these two moments:

**At Bethel**: Had nothing, but confident—"You help me, I'll help you"

**At the Jabbok crossing**: Had everything, but desperate—"None of my schemes work anymore" I cannot rely on my grabbing any more.

T**his is often how God works**. He has to bring us to the end of ourselves before we truly learn to depend on Him.

---

So there Jacob stood—alone in the dark, terrified to face his past, desperate for God's help. And that's when God showed up. Not with comforting words, but with a wrestling match. And from that strange night came a strange new name: Israel.

**II. That Night: Wrestling with God (6 minutes)**

**The Encounter**

On that desperate night, Genesis 32 tells us: **"A man came and wrestled with him."**

Notice: Jacob didn't go looking for God. **God came looking for Jacob.**

They wrestled all night. As daybreak approached, the man said, "Let me go."

But Jacob held on tightly: **"I will not let you go unless you bless me."**

The man asked, "What is your name?"

"Jacob,"（Grabbing） he replied.

Then the man said:

**"Your name will no longer be Jacob**（Grabbing）**, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."** (Genesis 32:28)

Then the man touched Jacob's hip socket, and his hip was dislocated. Clearly, they weren't in the same league strength-wise. The man was much more powerful.

And Jacob knew who that man was, because he said: "I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."

**The Strangest Name**

Now here's the question: What does "Israel" mean?

The verse right after gives us the explanation: "One who struggles with God and prevails."

Simply put: The man who defeated God.

What a strange name!

Now, I've heard that in America, when parents pick a name, most of the time they care about how it sounds—does it flow well? Is it beautiful? But in China, we care much more about the meaning. Which actually makes it easier for us to understand why God keeps changing people's names throughout the Bible.

Think about it: Abraham means "father of many nations"—a promise wrapped in a name. Isaac means "laughter"—but with two layers: first, the bitter laughter of unbelief when Abraham and Sarah heard God's promise; then, the joyful laughter when the baby finally came and God proved faithful.

But Israel? "God-fighter"? "The one who defeated God"?

For any believer, this sounds almost blasphemous. You don't defeat God. You worship Him. You obey Him. You certainly don't wrestle Him to the ground and win!

But this is the name God Himself chose. An entire nation would be called "Israel"—those who struggle with God and overcome.

What could this possibly mean?

A strange name for a strange night. I don't think Jacob fully understood what happened that night. But God did. God is not just the Lord of history—He's also a poet. He plants symbols in one generation that bloom into meaning in another. That wrestling match? It was pointing forward—to a hill, to a cross, to a moment when everything would finally make sense.

**III. Through the Keyhole of Wrestling, We See the Cross (5 minutes)**

**A Prophetic Picture**

Old Testament scholar Chad Bird wrote something profound in his book _Limping with God_. Some of you might remember Chad Bird—he also wrote _Hitchhiking with Prophets_, the book we read with Pastor Josh in our book club. That was our last book together.

Listen to what he says:

"Through the keyhole of Jacob's combat, we gaze into the crucifixion room. Jacob's descendants would lay hands on the Son of God... The one Jacob pinned to the ground would be nailed to a deadly tree. The Son of God, embracing His mortal defeat, would say, 'It is finished.' The trophy to humanity. The blessing to all of us Jacobs. **God lost. We won.**"

Do you see what he's saying?

That wrestling match—one man, one night, by a river—wasn't just about Jacob. It was a prophetic picture. A preview. A shadow of what all humanity would do to God—and what God would **allow us to do.**

**At the Cross** **（****Slow Down Thomas****）**

Think about what happened at the cross:

**Humanity "won"**: We successfully rejected, mocked, tortured, and killed God's Son.

**God "lost"**: Jesus died, was buried, descended to the dead.

Just as Jacob "defeated" the one who wrestled with him that night, all of humanity "defeated" Jesus—nailing Him to the cross.

**We are all Israel. We are all "the man who defeated God."**

**But Here's the Gospel**

Yet—and this is the paradox, the mystery and beauty of the gospel—**God's "defeat" became our blessing:**

- Jacob "defeated" God → Yet received blessing and a new name
- We "defeated" Jesus → Yet received redemption through His death

**God willingly "lost" so that we could "win."**

At the cross, a great exchange took place—the ultimate paradox:

- Jesus bore our sin → We received His righteousness
- He experienced God's wrath → We received God's favor
- He died our death → We received His life
- He was condemned → We were justified

Church, this is grace. This is the gospel. This is the beautiful paradox of the cross.

Now you might be thinking: "Well, sure—we can see this clearly now because we have the New Testament. We have the cross. We can look back and connect the dots."

But does this paradox—this pattern of humans 'defeating' God and receiving blessing—does it show up anywhere else in the Old Testament?

Let me show you. The answer is in Joseph's story.

Quote from Dr.Bird: rabbis said: **"The deeds of the fathers are signs for the sons."** What happened to Jacob set the stage for what would happen to his children.

**IV. Joseph: How This Pattern Works (7 minutes)**

**The Dream and the Pit**

When Joseph was seventeen, God gave him two dreams: his brothers and his parents would bow down to him.

Joseph told them about it.

His brothers' response? They were going to kill him.

"Here comes that **dreamer**! Come, let's kill him and throw him into a cistern... **Then we'll see what comes of his dreams!**" (Genesis 37:19-20)

Do you hear the pattern?

**God announces His plan → Humanity fights against it**

The brothers threw Joseph into a pit. Now, the Hebrew word for "pit" is _bor_—it means well, cistern（蓄水池）, prison(He was latter put in prison), but also symbolizes **death itself**.

~~Genesis specifically notes: "The cistern was empty; there was no water in it." This isn't just description—it's theology. This is a **pit of death**.~~

When Joseph was thrown into the pit:

- Cut off from his father's love
- Cut off from the promise
- The dream seemed utterly dead

**The brothers thought they won. They "defeated" the dreamer. They "defeated" God's plan.**

They were wrestling with God—just like their father Jacob. **Israel's sons became "Israel"—those who defeated God.**

The name wasn't just for one man. It was for a whole family. A whole nation. A whole pattern.

(Think about it: Just as all Adam's descendants inherit his rebellion—trying to be like God, deciding good and evil for themselves—so Jacob's sons inherited his wrestling. The whole human story is right here: We all want to defeat God. We all want to be our own god.)

**The Twist**

But here's where it gets amazing, a more detailed illustration about the paradox:

That pit—that place of death—**became the pathway to salvation**:

- Pit → Egypt → Prison → Palace
- Death → Life
- Dream defeated → Dream fulfilled

Later, Joseph was imprisoned—same word, _bor_. Two descents into the pit. Two "deaths."

But the very thing meant to destroy him became the means of his salvation and the salvation of many.

**God allowed the brothers to "win"—just as He allowed Jacob to "win."**

"The brothers walked away, dusting off their hands. They thought it was over. They thought they'd won. But God was just getting started."

**The Dream Fulfilled**

Years later, famine came. Joseph's brothers, desperate and starving, traveled to Egypt for food.

They stood before an Egyptian official, not recognizing Joseph. And they **bowed down** to him.

The dream came true. **Not despite the pit, but through the pit.**

The brothers who thought they "defeated" God's plan now found themselves saved by the very plan they tried to destroy.

There is a key verse in this Joseph's story.

**The Key Verse: Genesis 50:20**

When Joseph finally revealed himself, his brothers were terrified. They expected revenge.

But Joseph said something that summarizes the entire biblical pattern:

**"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."** (Genesis 50:20)

Let me break this down:

**"You intended to harm me"** = The brothers thought they won. They "defeated" the dreamer. They became "the men who defeated God."

**"But God intended it for good"** = God was working through their opposition all along. God **allowed** them to "defeat" Him so that through this "defeat," He could save them.

This is exactly what happened with Jacob~~:~~

**Joseph's brothers also became "Israel"—those who defeated God's plan, yet were saved by it.**

This is the same pattern (paradox) we see at the cross.

"Do you see the pattern now? It's not just Jacob. It's not just Joseph. It's the story of how God deals with all of us."

**V. We Are All Israel (4 minutes)**

**The Pattern Across Bible**

**We are all Israel. We are all "the man who defeated God."**

Or more accurately: **God allowed us to become "the man who defeated God," so that through this "defeat" of Him, we could be saved.**

**Our Natural Response**

Think about it: When we hear "you're a sinner, you need a Savior," what's our natural reaction? ( I do not know you, but when ever my wife try to point out my mistake. You know, it is not very easy.)

"I'm a good person! I do good things! Why would I need someone to save me?"

That's the brothers at the pit: "We don't need this dreamer! We don't need God's plan **Let's see what comes of his dreams!, I can be a better author of history than God.**"

That's us at the cross: "Crucify him! We don't need this Savior!"

**Every time we trust in our own goodness, ability, grabbing rather than Christ's righteousness, we're wrestling with God. We're becoming "Israel."**

**But Here's the Good News**

God **allows** it. He lets us "win."

Why? So that through our very rebellion, through our "victory" over Him, He can accomplish salvation.

**God even anticipated our sin, our rebellion—and wove it into the very fabric of His rescue plan. Our resistance to God became part of His salvation strategy. ( That is how powerful God is, that is the soft touch on Jacob's** Hip soket).

As Joseph said: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good."

As Peter preached on Pentecost: "This man was handed over by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge" (Acts 2:23).

**God outsmarted our schemes before we even made them.**

Joseph's brothers stood in Egypt, bowing before the brother they tried to destroy, and heard these words:

"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good."

**They thought they defeated God's plan. But God's "defeat" became their salvation.**

---

**The Good News**

And here's what makes this personal: We do the same thing. Every single day.

But here's what I want you to hear: **God comes seeking you.**

Not because you're strong enough to grab hold of Him, but because He's gracious enough to let you "defeat" Him so you can receive blessing.

**The invincible God willingly "lost" so that you could "win."**

This is the God Jacob wrestled with—desperate in the dark, afraid of his past.

This is the God Joseph's brothers wrestled with—hating the plan, throwing the dreamer in a pit.

This is the God we wrestle with—every time we think we're fine, every time we trust ourselves instead of Him.

And every time, God lets us "win"—so that through our defeat of Him, we can be blessed.

This is _**hesed**_. This is _**charis**_. This is **grace**—covenant royal love that's steadfast, undeserved, and unshakeable.

**This is who your God is.**
