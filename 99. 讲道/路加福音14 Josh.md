## 经文朗读

有一个安息日，耶稣到一个法利赛人首领家里去吃饭，他们就在一旁观察他。耶稣注意到所请的客人都在挑选首位的座位，就用比喻对他们说："你被人请去参加婚宴的时候，不要坐在首位上，因为可能有比你更尊贵的客人被邀请来。那样的话，主人就会过来对你说：'请让座给这位客人。'你就要羞愧地退到末位去了。相反，你被邀请的时候，要去坐在末位上，这样主人过来时就会对你说：'朋友，请往前坐。'那时候，你在所有客人面前就得到荣耀了。因为凡是抬高自己的，必要降为卑微；谦卑自己的，必要升为尊贵。"

耶稣又对邀请他的主人说："你办午餐或晚餐的时候，不要只邀请你的朋友、兄弟姐妹、亲戚和有钱的邻居，因为他们也会反过来邀请你，这样你就得到了回报。你办宴会的时候，应该邀请那些贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的人，你就有福了！因为他们没有什么可以回报你的。等到义人复活的时候，你就会得到真正的报答。"

这是主的福音。赞美归于你，哦基督。请大家坐下。

## 讲道

我们再次看到耶稣在前往耶路撒冷的路上。这是他事工的最后六个月——和上个星期我们讨论的是同一个阶段——他正在帮助那些听他讲话的人调整思维方式。这其实就是耶稣大部分教导的核心内容。他在说："这是一个普遍的真理，你们需要改变你们的想法。"

这跟其他教导没什么太大区别。这些教导和马太福音第5章的八福，或者马太福音5、6、7章的登山宝训，真的很相似。有时候我觉得我们应该强调八福里的"是"字。这就是作为基督徒，你本来就应该有的样子。这就是耶稣在这段教导中想要表达的重点。他想说："这就是你们的身份。你们现在还不是这样，但这就是你们需要成为的样子。你们需要被改变，你们的心需要被转化。"

这个世界会告诉你一套做法，但你知道吗？我要告诉你完全相反的东西。他把这个世界的价值观完全颠倒过来。比如说，去参加宴会，你当然想坐在大家都能看到你的好位子。但他说："实际上，去坐最不起眼的位子。"你在家里办派对，邀请所有有钱的朋友，他们会带好酒好菜，你也可能被邀请到他们家去。但耶稣说："实际上，你应该邀请那些流落街头的人。"

所以他完全颠覆了世界的常规思维——说实话，如果我们诚实面对自己，也颠覆了我们平常的想法——然后说："要与众不同。你们为什么能够与众不同？因为你们的救主耶稣为你们所做的一切。"

好，正如我刚才提到的，这段教导的背景其实来自箴言第25章——这当然是耶稣熟悉的箴言，也是这些他正在拜访的显要法利赛人所熟悉的。我要再读一遍这个箴言，因为我觉得这真的是整段教导的基础，或者可以说是主题：

"不要在王面前自抬身价；不要站在大人物的位子上。宁可有人对你说'请上来'，也不要在王子面前被人叫你退下去。"

好的，路加在第1节给了我们整个故事的背景。这就是为什么我们从第1节开始读，然后跳到第7到14节。实际上，我们跳过的那些经文讲的是耶稣在安息日医治了一个人，然后他问："什么更重要？让这个人继续残疾，还是我来医治他？你们觉得安息日的真正意义是什么？是严守一些规条，还是帮助别人？"这就是我们没有读的那部分内容。

但第一节给了我们整个事件的来龙去脉。法利赛人在仔细观察耶稣。如果你读过福音书，你会发现法利赛人对耶稣的敌意在他事工期间不断增长。一开始，他们对这个人挺好奇的。他行神迹，教导也很精彩。然后他在会堂里站起来说："其实，我就是神的儿子。你们在旧约里读到的关于将要来的弥赛亚——那就是我。"

他在整个事工过程中继续做一些让他们困惑的事情。他们想："也许他真的是神的儿子，但他没有吸引我们的美貌和威严。他也不是个政治领袖。"这开始让他们不安，因为他开始削弱法利赛人、撒都该人和律法教师的权威。所以他们对他越来越敌视，正在寻找陷害他的机会。

他们为什么想陷害他？因为如果他们能陷害耶稣，就能让其他犹太人也反对他，最终除掉他。他们的想法基本上是这样：如果我们能除掉他，而他又不是真的弥赛亚，那这整件事就会消失，会自己烟消云散。别想了。耶稣甚至会说："好啊，你们试着除掉我吧。你们会发现这事不会消失，因为我真的就是旧约圣经所说的那位。"当然，现在我们坐在这里，2000年后还在谈论他，所以确实没有消失。

但这就是他们想要达到的目的。他们想除掉他。所以他们仔细观察他，试图抓他的把柄。他们不知道的是，每次他们想抓他的把柄时，反而被他抓了把柄。

这对我们也是个教训，不是吗？我们也会尝试...对耶稣说，你不是真的那个意思吧。或者我们说："神的话并没有真的这样说"，即使圣经确实这样写了。我们试图抓神的错处。"你不是真的..."这就是魔鬼在创世记里说的第一个谎言："神岂是真说？神岂是真说？"

所以他们想设圈套陷害耶稣。这就是背景。然后耶稣给他们讲了三个不同的...好吧，第一件事他确实行了一个神奇的医治，然后他给他们讲了一些教导，都是关于谦卑的。说实话，这正是法利赛人所缺乏的，因为他们认为："你知道吗，我们已经遵守了律法。我们甚至在律法基础上又加了更多规定，这就是为什么我们能上天堂。"耶稣完全推翻了这种想法。

好，现在我们来看第一个比喻，出自第7到11节。"耶稣注意到客人们都在挑选首位的座位，就用比喻对他们说。"好，所以他在观察，看到法利赛人坐在最好的位子上——可能就像婚礼上的主桌那样。你可以这样想象。

"你被人请去参加婚宴的时候，不要坐在首位上，因为可能有比你更尊贵的客人被邀请来。那样主人就会过来对你说：'请让座给这位客人。'你就要羞愧地退到末位去了。相反，你被邀请的时候，要去坐在末位上，这样主人过来时就会对你说：'朋友，请往前坐。'那时候，你在所有客人面前就得到荣耀了。因为凡是抬高自己的，必要降为卑微；谦卑自己的，必要升为尊贵。"

所以我说过这真的是一个关于谦卑的教导。有句话经常被说成是C.S.路易斯说的，虽然大多数研究C.S.路易斯的学者都说他从来没说过这话。这实际上是瑞克·华伦说的："谦卑不是看轻自己，而是少想自己。"

所以谦卑不一定是说："我老是想着自己，我觉得自己应该坐个低一点的位子。"而是要总体上少想自己这个人。

我还能想到另一句话。我相信这是路德关于谦卑说的。他说："谦卑是最难拥有的品德，因为一旦你觉得自己很谦卑了，你就不谦卑了。"

"我真是个谦卑的人。"哦，现在我就不谦卑了。

这就是耶稣的教导如此困难的原因之一，你说："我要努力做个谦卑的人。"一旦我觉得自己达到了谦卑，现在我就不谦卑了，所以我必须重新开始，必须再次谦卑自己。这真的就是作为基督徒的整个人生，就是说："我做不到。我没有达到谦卑。我什么都没有达到。"所以我必须回到起点，必须说："我要谦卑自己。"

这确实有点困难。

我听过一个牧师的故事，他在另一个牧师的按立仪式上讲道。当一个牧师从神学院毕业，拿到学位，也就是神学硕士学位以后，通常他会被按立到一个教会。这是个仪式，有点像你们的就职典礼。就这么理解吧。

这个牧师说他讲完道以后，大家一起吃饭，他在反思自己的表现。他说："我想，好吧，我为这个仪式讲了道，所以我应该坐在这个被按立的牧师旁边。"于是他坐在那个刚被按立的牧师旁边，就是他为之讲道的那个人。当然，按理说他的家人应该坐在他旁边，其他桌子也都坐得差不多了，结果突然间他发现自己坐到了最后面去了。

所以他说，这个人在评论这件事时说："我们以为这种事只发生在耶稣的时代，但他说这种事确实发生在我身上了。我选了个尊贵的位子，一个大家都能看到我的地方，结果真的被人告知：'不行，你得去坐别的地方。'"

我想你们能理解这种感受。如果你排在队伍后面，有人说："其实不用，你到前面来"，那你就感到很荣耀。但如果你想："啊，我应该在前面，我很优秀。我配得这个位子。我配得这个。"然后有人过来对你说："你其实不配"，现在我就得很尴尬地走开，低着头，希望没人注意到刚才发生了什么，然后走到房间最后面去。

我想我可以花很长时间谈论礼貌的问题。我认为作为基督徒，有良好的礼貌修养是有价值的。我想我以前举过这个例子，如果我们教会里有个饮水机，你们大家刚做完某个活动，我想你们实际上会花15到20分钟都没人能喝到水，因为每个人都会说："不不不，你先喝。不，你先喝。不，你先喝。"结果没人真的能喝到水，因为每个人都在尝试表现得如此谦让。

但这不完全是这里要讲的重点。是的，这里有礼貌的因素，是的，有关于谦卑和你在这个世界上如何行为处事的一般原则。这确实是对的。我认为耶稣在这里要对法利赛人，也对我们讲的，是更深层的属灵道理。

法利赛人，你们要知道，真的就像是当时的顶层阶级。我要用个不太恰当的比喻，称他们为当时的"基督徒"。他们不是基督徒，但他们是犹太律法的忠实追随者，以至于他们还为自己发明了更多的律法。这些叫做米示拿，是口传的律法，加在摩西书中已有律法的基础上。所以他们做得过头了，认为自己真的很不错。

耶稣对他们说："你们觉得自己很好。在宴席上会怎么样呢？你们会让自己坐最后一位吗？还是会让自己坐第一位？"他在对他们说："把自己放在宴席客人的位置上想想。"当然，法利赛人是想要坐显要位置的。

有时候，我觉得我们作为基督徒，也有点这样。"看，我很不错。我是个好人。我比某某人强。我配得一个位置，我配得一个显要的位置。看看我。"

这实际上是魔鬼最厉害的诡计之一，就是让你相信你配得一些认可或显要地位，或者你配得在这个世界上为自己打响名声。你上大学时想："我要为自己闯出名堂。"你去参加毕业典礼，演讲者通常说什么？说你们将如何在这个世界上产生影响，你们将如何通过自己的所作所为为自己立名。这种想法很快就渗透到我们的心理中。"我要在我所做的事情上为自己立名。哦，看看我。我配得一个显要的位置。"

耶稣说："实际上，那些在这个世上寻求显要地位的人，愿意为了得到这种地位而不择手段的人，包括一再违背神的律法，他们将会被羞辱。"

这是一种马基雅维利式的人生方式，不是吗？就是为达目的不择手段。只要我最终能得到显要地位，我怎么达到那里并不重要。

实际上，我认为保罗在思考耶稣所展现的谦卑时，心里就想着这个道理。这是他在腓立比书第2章说的话。看看这是否和我们讨论的内容有共鸣。他说：

"凡事不可结党，不可贪图虚浮的荣耀；只要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。各人不要单顾自己的事，也要顾别人的事。你们当以基督耶稣的心为心：他本有神的形象，不以自己与神同等为强夺的；反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形象，成为人的样式；既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。所以，神将他升为至高，又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名，叫一切在天上的、地上的，和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝，无不口称耶稣基督为主，使荣耀归与父神。"

说实话，这就是重点。耶稣来，是因为他把你看得比他自己更重要。这真的就是真正的谦卑，就是把别人看得比自己更重要。

想想宴席上的位置，那是很显要的。是的，耶稣本来和神同坐。他在天堂里，他有宴席上最尊贵的座位。但他不认为那是需要紧抓不放的东西。相反，他下来了，他谦卑了自己。为什么？因为他认为你比他自己更重要。

我认为耶稣在路加福音中讲的第二个比喻也是关于谦卑的。"耶稣又对邀请他的主人说：'你办午餐或晚餐的时候，不要只邀请你的朋友、兄弟姐妹、亲戚和有钱的邻居，因为他们也会反过来邀请你，这样你就得到了回报。你办宴会的时候，应该邀请那些贫穷的、残疾的、瘸腿的、盲眼的人，你就有福了！因为他们没有什么可以回报你的。等到义人复活的时候，你就会得到真正的报答。'"

我读到这段话时第一个想到的是NFL球员在圣诞节前后的做法。你经常听到这种事。他们在送礼物上互相攀比。比如，一个四分卫给他整条进攻线的队友都买了汽车，然后另一个球员说："那很好，但我要给他们每人一块劳力士"，而劳力士比汽车还贵，所以如果他们想卖掉劳力士，那个礼物甚至更有价值。但他们知道自己会得到回报，通过这个要回礼的队友。所以他们都在用这些礼物相互攀比，知道他们会以某种方式得到回报，不管是在球场上的表现，他们会得到回报。"哦，我给他买车，现在他会为我好好阻挡，这样我就不会被擒杀那么多次。"但总的来说，他们知道自己会得到回报。他们不是纯粹因为慷慨而给予。他们得到回报的方式之一就是会有整篇文章写他们如何送出了这个伟大的、令人惊叹的、美好的礼物。

你们去过那些地方吗？我还是想着体育方面，因为我的思路就在那里。你去一个体育场，它有不同级别的捐赠者名单。我总觉得这很讽刺。他们有"2万到4万9千美元"，这是捐了那么多钱的人的名单。"哦，看他们多棒。他们的名字上了墙。"

"这一组捐了5万美元以上，他们真了不起。""这组人捐了10万到90万美元。""这个人捐了超过100万美元。"他们的名字都上了墙。

我一直想知道，如果你说："你们的名字实际上不会上墙，但我们仍然能得到这100万美元"，会发生什么。如果TD银行的名字不能出现在体育场上，他们还会给TD花园钱吗？不会，确实不会。汤姆看着我的眼神就像在说："这是世界上最荒谬的商业想法。"但这听起来很愚蠢，对吧？因为TD花园为什么要那样做？他们只是白白捐钱而得不到任何认可。

但有时候我们就采用这种完全相同的心态，对吧？我所做的事情必须为我赢得一些认可，我希望它们能在我的同辈中为我赢得认可。也许是我希望它们能为我赢得认可，让外面的世界看着我说："他是个好人。给那个高中足球场捐了2万2千美元。他的名字在那上面。铜牌会员。哇。我知道他可以是白金会员。""是的，我还是铜牌会员。是的。我在寻找我在神国里的位置。"

不是的，但说认真的，这听起来很愚蠢，但这些就是我们有时会采用的想法。更糟糕的是我们在教会里也采用这些想法。"我很想让这个人来教会，只是他们不会捐很多钱。他们看起来不像我，行为举止也不像我，肤色也和我不同。我从他们那里得不到任何回报。"

说实话，这可能是一个非常大的诱惑，特别是当你在做教会植堂这样的事工时。因为我可以说，我们可以有80个人来教会，从来不能捐任何东西，不能贡献任何东西，从街上走进来，理论上我们对自己说："哦，那太棒了。那很好。让他们听福音。"但我们内心说："实际上，这里有点味道。他们不能帮助我们得到新场地。也许他们不能提升我们敬拜的质量、氛围和感觉。他们不能给我们任何回报。"

这就是耶稣试图要对抗的观念。他试图说："看，作为基督徒实际上不意味着你就会得到回报。遵守所有规条不意味着你就会得到回报。"在阿摩司书中，他对旧约的百姓说："我憎恶你们的节期，因为你们奉我的名举行这些，但全都是虚伪的。你们这样做只是为了在这个世界上获得地位。我憎恶这样。"

所以这不完全是关于你们的行为，这是关于你们的心。这是关于你们的心。

所以从属灵的角度来说，这是在问：当你来教会时，你如何看待自己？你是把自己看作最终配得神的爱的人，配得拥有最显要位置的人，让每个人都来看着他们说"看这些上教会的人多么伟大"吗？

在美国曾经有一段时间，如果你去教会，这对你非常有利，就因为你去了教会。我想现在可能不那么明显了，但我认为在某种程度上仍然如此。还是你把自己看作真正需要恩典的人？"我来教会是因为，主啊，怜悯我这个罪人。"

我知道我在过去几个星期天都提到过，但耶稣的这些话真的就是信心的正确姿态。信心的姿态不是说："看看我。我多么了不起。神啊，我对你多么好。我在我所有同辈中多么了不起。"而是一颗来到神面前说话的心："我不配在任何东西上有我的名字。我配得在天堂有一席之地的唯一原因是因为我在基督里。这位基督谦卑了自己，顺服至死，且死在十字架上，现在把他的名字放在你身上，所以当神看着你时，他实际上看到一个小耶稣。他看到一个小耶稣。"

所以现在，当你出去在这个世界上生活时，你完全有自由看着你周围的其他人说："我把他们看得比我自己更重要。"因为我有一位把我看得如此重要，如此重要，以至于他本来在天堂有位置，他为了你来到地上。他的名字本来可以在TD花园上，但他说："我要把它拿下来。我要给出的不只是一大笔钱来维持运营。我要给出我的生命，因为我在乎你胜过在乎我自己。"

所以现在你可以去反
映那种爱。这是一种去宴席说"不，你先来"的爱。这是一种来到教会说"来吧，即使你从世俗角度没什么可以给我的，来吧。我希望你在这里。我希望你听到关于耶稣的信息"的爱。他给你提供如此丰富的恩典。

所以这就是这段经文真正要说的。这不只是关于礼貌，虽然你也能学到一两样关于礼貌的东西。这真的是关于那位谦卑自己、顺服至死、甚至死在十字架上的神，好让你能够从罪恶的地位、与神隔绝的地位被提升到坐在天上。因为正如神在耶稣升天时提升了他，他现在坐在神的右边。他已经为你在天堂预备了地方，有一天要带你到那里与他同在。

这就是这一切的真正意义。阿们。
# Sermon Transcript - Luke 14:1,7-14

## Scripture Reading

One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: "When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, 'Give this person your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors. If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

The Gospel of the Lord. Praise be to you, O Christ. And you may be seated.

## Sermon

We have Jesus once again on his way to Jerusalem. This is the last six months of his ministry - same place we were at last week - and he is providing an adjustment in the thinking of those listening to him. This is really what - this is really what so much of Jesus's teaching is about. It's about saying, "This is a generally true thing, and you need to adjust your thinking on it."

It's really not a lot different. These are really not a lot different than the Beatitudes that come to us in Matthew chapter 5, or the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapters 5, 6, and 7. Sometimes I think we should emphasize the "be" part of the Beatitudes. This is just who you are as a Christian. That's really what Jesus is trying to get at in this teaching. He's trying to say, "This is who you are. You aren't like this, and this is what you need to be like. You need to be transformed. Your heart needs to be transformed."

The ways of the world would say one thing, and guess what? I say something totally different. He flips things from this earth, and he turns them on their head. Like, go to a banquet, and of course you want to be in the spot where everyone sees you. He says, "Actually, go to the lowest spot." You have a party at your house and invite all your rich friends who bring nice bottles of wine and are going to bring nice steaks, and you might get invited to their house. "Actually, invite those who are on the streets."

And so he flips the normal way the world thinks - and frankly, if we're honest with ourselves, the normal way that we think about things - and says, "Be different. And why can you be different? Because of what your Savior Jesus has done for you."

Okay, as I mentioned, this really has Proverbs 25 in the background of it - certainly a proverb that Jesus would have known, and also a proverb that these prominent Pharisees, whose house he's in, would have known. I'm going to read that proverb again, because I think this really is the basis, or almost the theme, of the whole entire thing:

"Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among his great men. It is better for him to say to you, 'Come up here,' than for him to humiliate you before his nobles."

Okay, so Luke gives us the context in verse 1. This is why we go verse 1, and then it jumps to verses 7 to 14. Actually, the verses that we miss are Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath, and then he says, "What's better to do? Let the guy be crippled, or for me to heal him? What do you think the Sabbath is really all about? Is it all about keeping some rules, or about helping others?" That's the part that we don't have.

But the first verse gives us some context into what this whole thing is. The Pharisees are watching Jesus carefully. Now, if you read through the Gospels, you'll notice there's just this increasing amount of hostility towards Jesus from the Pharisees as he goes on, as his ministry continues. So it starts out, and they're kind of intrigued by this guy. He does great things. He has incredible teaching. And then he stands up in the synagogues and he says, "Actually, I am the very Son of God. So the things that you've read in the Old Testament about the Messiah who is to come - that is who I am."

And he continues throughout his ministry to do things that they go, "I guess maybe he is the Son of God, but he doesn't have beauty or majesty to attract us to him. He's not a political leader." That starts to bother them, and he starts to undermine the power that the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the teachers of the law have. So increasingly, they have more and more hostility towards him, and they're looking for a way to trap him.

Why do they want to trap him? Because if they can trap Jesus, then they can turn the rest of the Jewish people against him, and then they can also ultimately get rid of him. And the thought is basically this: if we can get rid of him, and he's not really the Messiah, then it'll just kind of go away and it'll fizzle out. Don't even talk about that. And Jesus will even say, "Yeah, go ahead, try to get rid of me. And what you're going to find is that it isn't just going to fizzle out, because I really am who the Old Testament scriptures talk about." And of course, now we're sitting here 2000 years later talking about him, so it has not fizzled out.

But this is what they're trying to do. They're trying to get rid of him. And so they're watching him carefully, trying to catch him in a misstep. And little do they know, every single time that they try to catch him in a misstep, he catches them in a misstep.

Maybe a little bit of teaching in that for us, right? We try to... Jesus, you didn't really mean that. Or we say, "God's Word doesn't really say that," even when it does. We try to catch God. "You don't really..." The first lie of the devil in Genesis: "Did God really say? Did God really say?"

So they're trying to catch Jesus in a trap. That's behind this. And Jesus tells them three separate... Well, the first one he does, he does a miraculous healing, but then he tells them these teaching lessons that are all about humility, which is, frankly, what the Pharisees lacked, because they said, "You know what, we've actually done the law. We keep things on top of the law, and that's why we're going to go to heaven." And Jesus turns that completely on its head.

Okay, so here we have the first parable, which comes from verses 7 through 11 here. "So when he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable." Okay, so he's looking out and he's seen the Pharisees, and they're seated at the best places - maybe like the head table at a wedding type of thing. You can think of it that way.

"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come to you and say, 'Give this person your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when the host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all the guests. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

So I mentioned that this is really going to be a teaching on humility. There's a quote - it's often attributed to C.S. Lewis, although most C.S. Lewis scholars will say C.S. Lewis never said this. This was really a Rick Warren statement, but: "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."

So humility isn't necessarily saying, "I think so much about myself, and what I think about myself is that I should, in this case, take a lower seat." It's about thinking about yourself less overall.

I can think of another one. This is, I believe, Luther on humility. He says, "Humility is the hardest virtue to have, because once you realize you have it, you don't have it anymore."

"I'm such a humble guy." Oh, now I cease to be humble.

This is what makes - one of the things that makes Jesus's teaching so hard is you say, "I strive to be humble." Once I've achieved humility, now I'm not humble, so I have to go back and I have to be humble again. And this is really the whole life of being a Christian - saying, "I cannot do it. I have not achieved humility. I have not achieved anything," and so I have to go back to the beginning, and I have to say, "I humble myself."

It's kind of hard.

I heard a story about a pastor, and he was preaching at an ordination of a different pastor. So when a pastor graduates from seminary, or graduates with his degree - his Master of Divinity - then oftentimes he is ordained into a church. It's kind of a ceremony where they would be like your commissioning. Sort of think of it that way.

And this pastor said he got done, and afterwards they had a meal, and the pastor said he was critiquing himself. He said, "I thought to myself, well, I preached for the thing, so I'm probably going to be sitting by this pastor who was ordained." So he sat down next to the guy who was going to be ordained, or who just had been ordained, who he had preached for. And sure enough, his family was supposed to sit next to him, and all the other tables were sort of filled in, and all of a sudden he's sitting at the very back.

So he said - this guy was commenting on this - and he said, "We think this is such a... you know, just happened in Jesus's day, but he said there's actually this very thing happened to me. I took a place of honor, a place where people could see me, and I was actually told, 'No, go and sit somewhere else.'"

And I think you understand this. If you go and you are in the back of the line, and someone says, "Actually, no, go to the front of the line," well, now you're honored. But if you think, "Ah, you know, I should be up in front, I'm pretty good. I deserve this. I deserve this," then someone comes to you and says, "You don't really..." Now I have to be humiliated, go walk and put my head down and hope no one really notices what just happened, and go to the back of the room.

I could talk for a long time about etiquette, I suppose. And I think that there is some value in saying, as a Christian, a Christian seeks to have good etiquette. I think I've made this illustration before that if we had a drinking fountain in the church, and you guys all just got done doing some activity, I imagine that you would actually spend like 15-20 minutes and no one would get a drink, because everyone would go, "No, no, no, you get the drink first. No, you get a drink first. No, you get a drink first." And then no one actually ends up getting a drink because everyone is trying to be so humble.

But it's not totally what this is about. Yes, there is etiquette here, and yes, there is a general sense of being humble and how you conduct yourself in this world. That's for sure true. I think Jesus is getting at a much deeper spiritual thing here with the Pharisees, and I think with us.

The Pharisees - you have to understand - were really like the top class. I'm going to anachronistically call them Christians of the day. They're not Christians, but they are followers of the Jewish law, so much so that they've actually invented laws for themselves. They're called the Mishnah. They were these spoken laws that were on top of the laws already prescribed in the book of Moses. And so they went above and beyond, and they saw themselves as really quite good.

And Jesus is telling them, "You think you're so good. How would this happen in a banquet? Would you seat yourself last? Or would you seat yourself first?" And he's telling them, "Put yourself in the shoes of someone at a banquet." And of course, the Pharisees wanted to have prominent seats.

Sometimes, I think this is how we are, a little bit, as Christians. "Look, I'm pretty good. I'm a good person. I'm better than so-and-so. I deserve a place, I deserve a place of prominence. Look at me."

This is one of the devil's greatest tricks, actually, to convince you that you deserve some recognition or some prominence, or that you deserve to have a name for yourself in this world. You go to college - "I'm going to make a name for myself." You go to a commencement service or address, and what is the speaker oftentimes talking about? How you are going to make a difference in this world, and you are going to make a name for yourself by the things that you do. And that just so quickly creeps into our mentality. "I am going to make a name for myself in something that I do. Oh, look at me. I deserve a place of prominence."

And Jesus says, "Actually, the people who seek this sort of prominence on this earth, and will do anything they can to have this prominence on this earth, including breaking God's law over and over and over again, they are going to be humiliated."

It's sort of a Machiavellian approach to life, isn't it? The end justifies the means. As long as I end up in the place of prominence, it doesn't really matter how I get there.

And in fact, I think Paul has this in the back of his mind, as he's thinking about the humility that Jesus showed. This is what he says in Philippians chapter 2. See if this rings a bell with what we're talking about. He says this:

"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage. Rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

Frankly, this is... Jesus came because he regarded you as more important than himself. This is really what true humility is - to regard others as more important than yourself.

Think about a place at a banquet. It's prominent. Yes, Jesus - he was seated with God. He's in heaven. He has like the ultimate seat at the banquet. But he doesn't consider that something to be grasped. But instead he comes down and he humbles himself. Why? Because he considered you more important than himself.

I think the second parable that Jesus tells in Luke is really also about humility. "Then Jesus said to his host, 'When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors. If you do, they may invite you back, and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.'"

The first thing that popped into my mind when I read that - I was thinking about how NFL players around Christmas... You'll hear this all the time. They try to one-up each other for gifts given. Like, one quarterback gives his entire offensive line cars, and then another guy is like, "That's good, but I'm going to give them each a Rolex," and the Rolex is worth more than the car, so if they wanted to sell the Rolex, that gift is even greater. But then he's going to be repaid, and he knows it, by this guy who's going to give him... And so they're all just trying to one-up each other with these gifts, knowing that they're going to be repaid somehow, whether that's performance on the field - that they're going to be repaid. "Oh, I give him a car, now he's going to block really well for me, so I don't get sacked as many times." But overall, they know that they're going to be repaid. They don't just give this because... And one of the ways they get repaid is that they get this whole article written about them about how they gave this great, incredible, wonderful gift.

Have you ever been to one of those... Again, I'm thinking in the vein of sports, because that's just where my mind went. But you go to a stadium, all right, and it has the different tiers of the members, of people who gave. I always thought this is so ironic. They have "$20,000 to $49,999" and this is the list of people who gave that much money. "Oh, look at them. They're so great. They got their name on a wall."

"And in this group, they gave $50,000 plus, they're really something." "This group of people gave $100,000 to $900,000." "And this person gave over a million dollars." They get their name on a wall.

I've always wondered what would happen if you said, "You actually don't get your name on the wall at all, but we still get the million dollars." Would TD Bank still give the money to TD Garden if they didn't get their name on the stadium? No, exactly, yeah. Tom's looking at me like, "This is the most absurd business idea in the world." But it sounds... it's foolish, right? Because, of course, why would TD Garden do that? They're just giving away their money to have no recognition.

But this is sometimes... we adopt this exact mindset, right? The things that I do must earn me some recognition, and I hope that they earn me recognition among my peers. Perhaps it is... I hope they earn me recognition in that the outside world looks at me and says, "He's a pretty good guy. Donated $22,000 to that high school football field. He's got his name up there. Bronze member. Wow. I know he could be a platinum." "Yeah, I'm still bronze, right? Yeah, yeah. I'm looking for my place in the kingdom of God."

No, but in all seriousness, it sounds foolish, but these are the ideas that we sometimes adopt. And the even worse thing is when we adopt them with church. "I would love for this person to come to church, except they aren't going to give a lot of money. They don't look like me. Don't act like me. Same skin color as I do. I'm not getting something back from them."

I'll be honest, this can be an incredibly big temptation, especially when you're in something like a church plant. Because I can say we can have 80 people who come to church and never can't give anything, can't contribute anything, walk in off the street, and in theory, we say to ourselves, "Oh, that'd be great. That'd be cool. Hearing the gospel..." But we say, "Actually, it's a little stinky in here. They don't contribute to us getting a new space. Maybe they don't contribute to how our worship sounds, the atmosphere, the vibe. They don't give us something back in return."

This is really what Jesus is trying to combat. He's trying to say, "Look, actually being a Christian doesn't mean that you're just going to get things in return. Following all the rules doesn't mean you're just going to get things in return." In the book of Amos, he actually tells the Old Testament people, "I hate your feasts because you do them in my name, but it's all hypocrisy. You just do them to get standing in this world. I hate that."

And so it's not all just about your actions. It's about your heart. It's about your heart.

And so spiritually speaking, it's asking this: when you come to church, how do you see yourself? Do you see yourself as someone who ultimately is deserving of God's love, who deserves to have a most prominent spot that everyone comes and looks at them and says, "Look at how great they are, these people who go to church"?

There was a time in America where if you went to church, this was incredibly advantageous for you, just because you went. I think that's maybe a little less so now, but I think it still is to some extent. Or do you see yourself as someone who really just needs it? "I come to church because, Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner."

I know I've mentioned it the last couple of Sundays, but these words from Jesus are really what the posture of faith is. The posture of faith doesn't say, "Look at me. I'm so great. I'm so great to you, God. I'm so great among all of my other peers." It's actually a heart that comes before God and says, "I don't deserve to have my name on anything at all. The only reason that I deserve to have a space in heaven is because I am in Christ. This Christ, who humbled himself and became obedient to death on a cross, has now put his name on you, and so that when God looks at you, he actually sees a little Jesus. He sees a little Jesus."

And so now, as you go out and you live in this world, you have the complete freedom to look at others around you and to say, "I view them more highly than I view myself." Because I have one who viewed me so highly - so highly that he had a place in heaven. He comes down to earth for you. He had his name on TD Garden, and he said, "I'm going to take it off. I'm going to give more than just a ton of money to keep it going. I'm going to give my very life because I care more about you than I care about myself."

And so now you get to go and reflect that love. And it's a love that goes to the banquet and says, "No, you first." It's a love that comes to church and says, "Come, even if you have nothing to offer me from a worldly standpoint, come. I want you here. I want you to hear about Jesus." He offers you so incredibly much.

So that's what this text is really about. It's not just about etiquette, although you can learn a thing or two. It's really about the God who humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross, that you might be exalted from a place of sin, a place separated from God, to sitting in the heavens. Because just as God exalted him, Jesus, on the ascension, he now sits at the right hand of God. He has prepared a place for you in heaven and is going to take you one day to be there with him.

That's what this is all about. Amen.
