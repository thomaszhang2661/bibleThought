为托马斯在海港路德会所做的讲道，2025年9月14日

《路加福音》15:1–10

1那时，所有的税吏和罪人都靠近耶稣，要听他讲道。

2但法利赛人和律法教师们私下里嘀咕说：“这个人接纳罪人，还和他们一起吃饭。”

3于是，耶稣对他们讲了这个比喻：

4“你们当中，谁有一百只羊，丢了一只，难道他不会把那九十九只留在旷野，去寻找那只迷失的羊，直到找到它吗？

5当他找到它时，他会高兴地把它放在肩上，

6回家。然后他召集他的朋友和邻居，说：‘和我一起高兴吧，我找到我那只迷失的羊了。’

7我告诉你们，同样地，一个罪人悔改，天上的喜乐，会比为九十九个不需要悔改的义人还要大。

8“或者，一个妇人有十个银币，丢了一个。难道她不会点上灯，打扫屋子，仔细寻找，直到找到它吗？

9当她找到它时，她会召集她的朋友和邻居，说：‘和我一起高兴吧，我找到我那枚失落的银币了。’

10同样地，我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，上帝的天使们也会因此而欢喜。”

我们家附近有一个民宿，大概每周我们都会看到同样的场景上演。游客们自信地走在我们这条街上，直到走到尽头，突然必须决定：我们是向右走还是向左走？接下来通常很滑稽—夫妻争吵，人们指指点点，手机疯狂地搜索方向。

有时我走到外面问：“嘿，我能帮你们找东西吗？”毫无例外，我总是听到同样的回答：“不用，我们会搞定的。”

也许这更多地说明了我爱提供“没被请求的帮助”这个习惯。但我认为它揭示了一个更深层的真相：我们不喜欢承认自己需要帮助。我们不喜欢承认自己迷失了。

在今天这两个比喻中，耶稣提醒我们，迷失是堕落后作为有罪的人类所包含的一部分。他向我们展示了他对那些迷失之人的深切关怀—他如何寻找他们，以及当他们被找到时，他又是如何喜乐的！

《路加福音》第15章可能是路加所有著作（包括《路加福音》和《使徒行传》）中最受欢迎的一章。它包含了三个比喻：迷失的羊、失落的钱币和迷失的儿子—或者说浪子。所有这些都揭示了耶稣对迷失之人那巨大的爱。

请注意这些比喻的背景。耶稣在他传道的最后六个月里教导众人，他的听众很混杂。路加告诉我们，听他讲道的包括“税吏和罪人”，以及“法利赛人和律法教师”。

法利赛人和律法教师对耶稣和税吏、罪人一起吃饭的行为反应消极。为什么？因为通过和他们一起吃饭，耶稣是在表明他关心他们—甚至欢迎他们。他视他们为宝贵的。然而，法利赛人和律法教师“嘀咕”。一个更好的翻译可能是“抱怨”。这与《出埃及记》、《民数记》和《约书亚记》中，以色列人在旷野里“抱怨”上帝时所用的词是同一个。通过选择这个词，路加巧妙地指出一个真相：耶稣是上帝的儿子—而法利赛人和律法教师们拒绝耶稣对罪人的关爱，实际上是在抱怨上帝自己。

有了这个背景，让我们来看看第一个比喻：

“你们当中，谁有一百只羊，丢了一只，难道他不会把那九十九只留在旷野，去寻找那只迷失的羊，直到找到它吗？当他找到它时，他会高兴地把它放在肩上，带回家。然后他召集他的朋友和邻居，说：‘和我一起高兴吧，我找到我那只迷失的羊了。’我告诉你们，同样地，一个罪人悔改，天上的喜乐，会比为九十九个不需要悔改的义人还要大。”

为了理解和深入这两个比喻，我们可以遵循耶稣简单的架构：

- 有东西迷失了
- 有一个大搜寻
- 有东西被找到了
- 有巨大的喜乐（两次）

有东西迷失了。

这里很明显：一只羊。圣经经常用羊来比喻人（参见《以西结书》第34章）。《以赛亚书》说“我们都像羊一样走迷了…”为什么？一方面，这个比喻对于牧羊文化来说很自然。但另一方面，它也说明了我们自身的一些特质：我们很容易走偏。我们不总听牧羊人的声音。没有上帝，我们就会迷失。

这和我们的文化是相悖的，不是吗？自助书籍不会鼓励我们承认自己迷失了—它们告诉我们去“找到自我”。甚至在日常用语中，“迷失方向”是一种侮辱。但耶稣却颠覆了这个说法。

有一个大搜寻。

解经家指出，牧羊人通常在晚上清点羊群。这意味着这个牧羊人会在夜间进入旷野去寻找。这既危险又不方便，但他仍然进入了旷野。

有东西被找到了。

牧羊人找到迷失的羊时，他欢喜。他把它扛在肩上，带回家。这只羊为被找到做了什么贡献吗？什么也没有—除了迷失。如果任由它自己，这只羊只会继续游荡。

这指向一个重要的教义：我们的救恩完全是上帝的工作。我们没有为被找到做出任何贡献。如果任由我们自己，我们只会跑得更远。正如路德所说：“我们对救恩唯一贡献的，是罪和叛逆，”以及，“我不能凭自己的思想或选择来相信我的主耶稣基督或归向他。”我们带给救恩的，只有我们的迷失。

有巨大的喜乐。

牧羊人欣喜若狂！他为那只迷路的羊摆设了宴席。

- 法利赛人和律法教师会觉得这很愚蠢。为什么为那个迷路的开派对，而不是为那九十九个安分的？但这没有抓住重点：重点在于那个出去寻找的牧羊人—这是他们不愿去做的事。
- 注意牧羊人找到羊后的反应。他责备它了吗？威胁说如果再走失就把它赶出羊群吗？教训它了吗？没有，他只是简单地欢喜，“我找到我那只迷失的羊了。”

第二个比喻遵循同样的模式：

“或者，一个妇人有十个银币，丢了一个。难道她不会点上灯，打扫屋子，仔细寻找，直到找到它吗？当她找到它时，她会召集她的朋友和邻居，说：‘和我一起高兴吧，我找到我那枚失落的银币了。’同样地，我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，上帝的天使们也会因此而欢喜。”

同样地，**有东西迷失了**：一个银币—价值大约一天的工资。不算多，但对她来说仍然很宝贵。

有一个**大搜寻**：她点上灯，打扫，寻找，直到找到它。

**有东西被找到了**：这个银币对被找到没有任何贡献。

**并且有巨大的喜乐**：她叫来朋友和邻居一起庆祝。

**应用**

- 你感到迷失了吗？从属灵上讲，这是有道理的。在今天早上的忏悔中，我们承认我们是迷失的。路德说我们是“迷失和被定罪”的受造物—但基督已经救赎了我们。
- 没有人能犯的罪，大过耶稣的爱。他为全世界的罪而死，每个灵魂都是用他的生命换来的。他差遣我们进入世界，将他的声音分享给那些仍在游荡的人。
- 圣灵通过圣道和圣事来创造信心。他的羊听他的声音。在黑暗中游荡的我们，被引向了光明。这在你们身上发生了！这是恩典：“当我们还是罪人的时候，基督就为我们死了”（《罗马书》5:8）。“你们得救是靠着恩典，借着信心—这并不是出于你们自己，而是上帝的礼物”（《以弗所书》2:8–9）。
- 当迷失的人被找到时，就会有喜乐……在地上和天上都是如此。我们在洗礼中、在新成员身上、在充满喜乐的敬拜中看到了这一点。而在天上，每个悔改的罪人都会有喜乐。


Sermon for Thomas Preached at Harbor Lutheran 9/14/2025                                                   Luke 15:1–10

   1Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 2But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

   3Then Jesus told them this parable: 4“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ 7I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

   8“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 9And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ 10In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

We have an Airbnb near our house, and about once a week we see the same scene play out. Tourists walk confidently down our street until they reach the end and suddenly have to decide: do we go right or left? What follows is often comical—spouses arguing, people pointing, phones frantically searching for directions.

Sometimes I step outside and ask, “Hey, can I help you find something?” And without fail, I always hear the same response: “No, we’ll figure it out.”

Maybe that says more about my habit of offering unsolicited help than anything else. But I think it reveals a deeper truth: we don’t like to admit when we need help. We don’t like to admit when we’re lost.

In our two parables today, Jesus reminds us that being lost is part of what it means to be a sinful human being after the fall. He shows us how deeply He cares for those who are lost—how He seeks them out, and how He rejoices when they are found!

Luke 15 may be the most beloved chapter in all of Luke’s writings (both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts). It contains three parables: the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son—or prodigal son. All of them reveal the tremendous love of Jesus for the lost.

Notice the setting of these parables. Jesus is teaching in the last six months of His ministry, and His audience is mixed. Luke tells us that those listening include “tax collectors and sinners,” as well as “Pharisees and teachers of the law.”

The Pharisees and teachers of the law react negatively to Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners. Why? Because by eating with them, Jesus was showing that He cared for them—even welcomed them. He saw them as valuable. The Pharisees and teachers of the law, however, “muttered.” A better translation might be “grumbled.” This is the same word used for the Israelites in the wilderness, when they “grumbled” against God in Exodus, Numbers, and Joshua. By choosing this word, Luke subtly points to the truth that Jesus is the Son of God—and that in rejecting Jesus’ care for sinners, the Pharisees and teachers of the law were, in fact, grumbling against God Himself.

With this context in place, let’s look at the first parable:

“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.”

To understand and walk through both parables, we can follow Jesus’ simple outline:

·       Something is lost

·       There is a great search

·       Something is found

·       There is much rejoicing (x2)

**Something is lost.**  
Here, it’s obvious: a sheep. The Bible frequently uses sheep as an illustration for people (see Ezekiel 34). Isaiah says “We all like sheep have gone astray…” Why? On one hand, the metaphor would have been natural for a shepherding culture. But on the other hand, it says something about us: we wander easily. We don’t always listen to the shepherd’s voice. Without God, we are lost.

This runs counter to our culture, doesn’t it? Self-help books don’t encourage us to admit being lost—they tell us to “find ourselves.” Even in daily speech, “get lost” is an insult. But Jesus flips the script.

**There is a great search.**  
Commentators note that shepherds often counted their sheep in the evening. That means this shepherd would have gone into the wilderness at night to search. Dangerous, inconvenient, and yet he goes into the wilderness.

**Something is found.**  
The shepherd rejoices when he finds the lost sheep. He lifts it onto his shoulders and carries it home. What did the sheep contribute to being found? Nothing—other than getting lost. If left on its own, the sheep would have kept wandering.

This points us to an important doctrine: our salvation is entirely God’s work. We don’t contribute to being found. If left to ourselves, we would only run further away. As Luther said, “The only thing we contribute to our salvation is sin and rebellion,” and, “I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in Jesus Christ my Lord or come to Him.” The only thing we bring to salvation is our lostness.

**There is much rejoicing.**  
The shepherd is overjoyed! He throws a feast for the one who had strayed.

·       The Pharisees and teachers of the law would have found this foolish. Why throw a party for the wanderer instead of the ninety-nine who stayed? But that misses the point: the focus is on the shepherd who goes searching—something they were unwilling to do.

·       Notice the shepherd’s response after finding the sheep. Does he scold it? Threaten to remove it from the group if it wanders again? Lecture it? No, he simply rejoices, “I have found my lost sheep.”

The second parable follows the same pattern:

“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

Again, **something is lost**: a coin—worth about a day’s wages. Not much, but still precious to her.

There is a **great search**: she lights a lamp, sweeps, and searches until she finds it.

**Something is found**: the coin contributes nothing to being found.

**And there is much rejoicing**: she calls friends and neighbors to celebrate.

**Application**

·       Do you feel lost? Spiritually speaking, that makes sense. In our confession this morning, we admitted we are lost. Luther says we are “lost and condemned” creatures—but Christ has redeemed us.

·       No one can out-sin the love of Jesus. He died for the sins of the whole world, each soul purchased at the cost of His life. He sends us into the world to share His voice with the still-wandering.

·       The Holy Spirit works through Word and Sacrament to create faith. His sheep hear His voice. Wandering in darkness, we are turned to light. That happened to you! It is grace: “While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God” (Ephesians 2:8–9).

·       When the lost are found, there is rejoicing…on earth and in heaven. We see it in baptism, in new members, in worship filled with joy. And in heaven, there is rejoicing over every sinner who repents.
