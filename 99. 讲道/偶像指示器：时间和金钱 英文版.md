# Hidden Idols: Rethinking Our Life Priorities Through Stewardship

The First Commandment - "You shall have no other gods before me" - warns us about the secret idols hiding deep in our hearts. Today's Christians rarely bow down to golden statues, but invisible idols can quietly take over the throne of our hearts without us even noticing.

## Being a Manager, Not the Owner

Everything we have - our health, abilities, time, and money - doesn't really belong to us. God has given us these things to manage, not to own. Understanding this changes everything about how we see ourselves. We're managers here on earth, not owners.

This way of thinking affects how we view our whole lives. God gave us healthy bodies and different gifts so we can work and turn our time into money. When you think about it, time and money are pretty similar - they're both gifts from God that we need to manage wisely.

Here's what really matters: how we use these resources shows what we truly care about deep down.

## Time and Money: The Tell-Tale Signs

Want to know what's really important to you? Look at how you spend your time and money. These are like a mirror that shows what's really going on in your heart.

When you notice that most of your time and money goes to one thing, it's worth asking yourself: Has this thing become more important to me than it should be? Am I managing these gifts the way God wants me to, or am I serving my own personal idol?

There are two completely different ways to think about this:

**The Manager Mindset**: I'm God's manager, taking good care of the resources and work He's given me.

**The Owner Mindset**: My gifts, abilities, time, and money are all here to help me get what I want in life.

This difference in thinking changes everything about how we relate to the world around us. The First Commandment reminds us: "You shall have no other gods before me." We should use this law every day to examine our lives, confess our sins to God, and accept the forgiveness that Jesus offers us.

## Life is Short, Eternity is Long

"You can't take it with you" - this old saying reminds us that we can't really own anything on earth. Our time here is like morning mist that disappears quickly, and soon we'll be with the Lord in paradise. Thinking about eternity helps us figure out what really matters.

When we remember that we're only temporary managers and that everything on earth will pass away, it becomes easier to spot the idols in our lives. Career success, relationships, material things, even our families and children - these are all good things, gifts from God.

But when they become the whole meaning of our lives, when we forget we're managers and start acting like owners, when we can't accept our place as created beings and want to be in control of everything - that's when they become our idols.

## What God Really Treasures

Through the First Commandment, God isn't trying to take away our "precious things." He wants to get what's precious to Him - our eternal souls.

To God, our earthly "treasures" are gifts He's given us for this life, but what He really cares about is us as people. He loves us so much that He was willing to give up everything to buy us back.

Jesus told three parables in Matthew 13:44-50 that show us God's heart toward us:

> "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it..."

God values us so much that He's willing to pay any price to have us. He wants everyone to be saved and doesn't want anyone to be lost. He uses the First Commandment to protect us from falling into the enemy's hands and being thrown into the fire at the end of the world.

If our wealth, status, work, or even our family and children become idols, it's better to let them go and accept God's costly purchase of us to gain eternal life, rather than hold onto them tightly and end up in hell.

## A Simple Exercise: Finding Your Hidden Idols

Try this quiet reflection exercise:

1. Write down all the precious things in your life on pieces of paper - health, family, work, dreams, wealth, children, reputation, Bible, church, God, etc.
    
2. Imagine having to give them up one by one, starting with the less important ones.
    
3. When you find something that fills you with fear at the thought of "absolutely cannot lose this," when you feel like life would be meaningless without it, you might have found an idol in your heart.
    

During this process, remind yourself: None of these things really belong to me. They're all things God has entrusted me to manage. Is my attachment to them stronger than my reverence for the One who truly owns them?

## Staying Alert: Daily Homework for Spotting Idols

Spotting idols isn't a one-time thing - it requires constant watchfulness. Our hearts change, and today's idol might be replaced by a new obsession tomorrow.

The key is developing sensitivity and regularly examining yourself from a manager's perspective:

- Am I using these resources the way the Owner wants me to?
- What is demanding loyalty that goes beyond my duties as a manager?
- What do my time and money choices say about my heart's values?

Only when we remember our role as managers and look at temporary earthly things from an eternal perspective can we stay clearheaded on our faith journey and let the real Owner truly reign on the throne of our hearts.

## Rethinking "Giving": A Broader View of Stewardship

In many churches, "giving" is often narrowly understood as donating money to the church. But from a stewardship perspective, giving can mean much more.

Dr. Wei once shared his personal view: he considers all family resources not spent on himself and his children as giving - including what goes to the church and to other people. This definition comes from a simple truth: God gave us gifts and resources so we can love God and love our neighbors.

Therefore, all time and money used to serve others rather than satisfy ourselves is essentially giving.

God gives every family and person unique circumstances and perspectives so we can see various needs around us: aging parents, friends in trouble, brothers and sisters in church, neighbors in the community. Supporting ministries that preach God's word is certainly important, but responding to these specific needs around us is also giving.

This understanding gives us a practical tool for examining our lives: regularly review how you allocate your time and money - how much for yourself, how much for others? This simple ratio reflects our heart's true values and reminds us whether we're faithfully carrying out our stewardship duties.
