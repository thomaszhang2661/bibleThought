朋友们，上帝是我们的避难所。祂是我们可以信赖的坚固磐石。阿门。

也许你们听说了：上周有人说耶稣要来接信徒上天堂了。一些人以为耶稣会在周二把所有真正的基督徒接走，让他们避开世界末日前的各种灾难。

当然，这根本没发生。以后也不会发生。根本不会有这种事——这是对圣经教导的严重误解，可惜这种错误观念在美国教会里传播得太广了，很多人以为只要你信圣经，就必须相信"被提"，不信的话就是不信圣经的异端。

这完全错了。随着这个教会年度即将结束，我计划在11月讲解《帖撒罗尼迦后书》。这卷书是理解圣经关于世界末日教导的基础。这书不长，只有三章，我们会用11月的前四个主日来学习。

说到世界末日，大家首先想到的可能是《启示录》。《启示录》确实讲末日的事，但它被放在圣经最后是有原因的——要读懂《启示录》，你需要先熟悉圣经其他部分。你需要先读像《帖撒罗尼迦后书》这样比较直白的书，才能理解《启示录》里的异象和图像。

《启示录》不是世界末日的时间表。它是从不同角度描述从五旬节开始的历史。比如《启示录》4-8章，更像是从上帝的角度看历史。

我们今天读的《启示录》12章这段，是从"撒但在做什么"这个角度看历史。在这部分里，约翰看到的异象比较可怕——强大的怪兽欺压人类，攻击教会；撒但这条龙在狂怒。但即使在这个显示撒但全力施展邪恶的部分，也很清楚：他失败了。撒但失败了。大龙被打败了。

## 撒但是个堕落的天使

撒但原本是天使。《希伯来书》告诉我们，天使被造出来是为了"服侍上帝"。他们为上帝工作。我们可能会问：全能的上帝为什么需要天使来服侍祂？任何答案都只是猜测。圣经没说为什么上帝要造出执行祂旨意的存在，而不是直接自己做一切事。我们只知道：上帝造了天使，他们服侍祂。

至少，有些天使是这样的。有些反叛了。我们读经的第一句，《启示录》12:7："在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战，龙也同它的使者去争战。"

在某个时候，撒但和其他一些天使背叛了上帝。我们无法想象天使之间的战争会是什么样子。我们也不知道撒但为什么要反叛。根据圣经的几段话，我猜测他可能觉得服侍人类太屈辱了。诗人约翰·弥尔顿在《失乐园》中暗示，撒但想要取代上帝，或者让自己与上帝平等。但圣经没有明说他的动机。

不管动机如何，结果很清楚：他失败了。第8节说："并没有得胜，天上再没有它们的地方。"这场古老的战争主要就是我们所说的撒但被"赶出天堂"。但这不是唯一的一次。

你看，在那场战争后，《约伯记》1:6告诉我们："神的众子来侍立在耶和华面前，撒但也来在其中。"撒但在上帝面前出现，引出了《约伯记》的故事——上帝允许撒但用严重的试炼来考验约伯，显明约伯的信心。

当耶稣在福音书里说看见"撒但从天上坠落，像闪电一样"时，祂指的不是目睹了撒但古时被大天使米迦勒打败，而是指祂七十二个门徒传福音的成果。通过福音，上帝创造信心。通过信心，我们在上帝面前被称为义。所以当撒但想要在上帝面前控告我们时，因为信心，我们已经被宣判无罪了。他再次被赶出天堂。用法律术语说，他的起诉被驳回了。

## 撒但的各种名字

在我们读的经文里，撒但有很多名字。他被叫做"大龙"。在古代各种文化的神话里，"龙"更像是巨蛇，但古人认为它们和普通蛇不同。关于亚历山大大帝的传说里提到遇见"龙"的故事。在印度，他的军队被警告不要打扰住在附近洞穴里被当地人崇拜的龙。龙把头和脖子伸出洞穴朝他们嘶嘶叫，仅这部分身体就有三十米长，眼睛像士兵的盾牌那么大。所以在古代文化中，龙被描绘为巨大、强大的生物，通常还能说话，对重要人物产生重要影响。

这就是撒但被称为"龙"的文化背景。他是个强大的存在，想要影响这个世界的事件和历史。

他也叫"蛇"，特别是"那古蛇"。这节经文证实了伊甸园里的蛇就是撒但。《创世记》从没明确说那蛇是撒但，但这对摩西来说也没必要说明，因为"撒但"当时还不是专门的名字。

"撒但"——龙的另一个名字——原本是希伯来语，简单意思就是"敌人"。摩西写《创世记》时，"撒但"还不是这个特殊堕落天使的专有名字。后来才这样使用的。这不意味着撒但不存在，只是当时他不叫"撒但"。

他还被叫"魔鬼"。这也不完全是名字，而是希腊语"diabolos"。英语"diabolical"（恶魔般的）就来自这个词。在英语里"diabolical"大致意思是"邪恶的"。但"Diabolos"更具体——意思是"说坏话的人、诽谤者"。魔鬼就是那种说别人坏话的，要么撒谎中伤别人，要么即使说真话也用最恶毒的方式说。魔鬼质疑别人的动机，让你对别人产生最坏的印象。

做魔鬼，做"diabolos"，违反了第八条诫命。马丁·路德在解释这条诫命时提醒我们："上帝在这里禁止背后说人坏话这种可恶、可耻的恶习，魔鬼一直在鼓动我们这样做。我们都很坏，不能忍受别人说我们坏话，但也不能忍受别人说他人的好话。"

"魔鬼"这个词用来指这个特殊的堕落天使，但圣经也用它来警告我们说话要小心。在《提摩太前书》里，保罗说提摩太教会的一些妇女需要被警告不要"恶意传话"。希腊原文就是"像魔鬼一样"。

撒但最后一个名字在第10节后半部分："控告者"。"控告者"是法律术语，在古希腊法庭上，介于检察官和原告之间，负责提出定罪证据。

## 撒但的策略和我们的问题

撒但这个敌人，是魔鬼、诽谤者，也是控告者——提出真实犯罪证据的人。他确实有真实证据可以提出。你和我都做过错事。我们经常表现得很"魔鬼"——我们编造关于同事的恶毒故事来贬低他们；我们转发别人的私信截图让朋友们反对某人；我们叙述争吵时只说别人的无礼无心，隐瞒自己的恶劣行为。撒但看到这一切！他完全打算有一天在上帝面前提出这些事，论证你不配与上帝同在，而应该和大龙及其使者一起受罚。

这个希望就是撒但现在的动力。这让他"每天早上起床"（比喻说法）。他想让你犯罪。他是龙——他很强大。他不像上帝那样全知，但他在很长时间里观察了很多人类。他懂得我们的心理。他知道如何试探你。用法律术语说，撒但喜欢做的可以叫"诱捕"——他试图安排情况让我们犯罪，这样我们就会与上帝分离，和他一起永远受罚。

## 上帝的保护

因此，我们要不断祷告上帝派遣圣天使保护我们免受撒但攻击。米迦勒和他的使者很久前就把撒但和他的使者赶出天堂，他们也能把他们从你身边赶走。撒但当时"没有得胜"，现在也不够强大。所以我们听到以利沙向他仆人保证："不要惧怕！与我们同在的比与他们同在的更多。"撒但和他的使者在数量上被上帝的使者超过；撒但和他的使者没有上帝的使者强大。

这是我们自信的理由，但不要变得傲慢。狮子虽然不如动物园的铁栏杆强，但如果你把手伸进栏杆，看看会发生什么。如果你主动走向撒但的道路，离开上帝使者的保护，你就是在自找毁灭。轻视大龙是傲慢的表现。

但面对撒但的威胁，你可以有信心。你不需要主动找他，他就会攻击你——他日夜寻求这样做。路德在解释主祷文"救我们脱离凶恶"时写道："魔鬼不仅是骗子，也是杀手。他不断寻求夺取我们的生命，在能发泄愤怒的地方就发泄。因此，我们在地上除了不断祈祷对抗这个大敌，没有别的事要做。因为如果上帝不保守我们，我们连一个小时都不会安全。"

"如果"是关键词。上帝确实保守我们。祂派遣使者阻挡这个敌人。祂已经为我们的罪付出了代价——那些撒但会用来控告我们的罪——用祂儿子的死来偿还。所以我们的经文提醒我们，上帝的子民"因羔羊的血和自己所见证的道"胜过撒但。

因羔羊的血胜过撒但，这我们理解：基督为我们的罪付出代价。但因"自己所见证的道"胜过撒但是什么意思？

## 我们的得胜

意思是这样：当魔鬼说你是魔鬼，提醒你从你不受控制的舌头和手指说出、做出的恶事时，你可以对他说："这样的罪我确实犯过；但你现在有什么权利谈论它们？因为我的主耶稣基督为我承担了罪，使我在祂里面成为上帝的义。"

大龙，你被打败了！控告者，案件结案了！蛇，你的头被踩碎了！感谢上帝，天军的主！阿门。

# [The Great Dragon Is Thrown Down!](https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=2888324&post_id=174556839&utm_source=post-email-title&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=6es6dy&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozODc2MjYzMjYsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE3NDU1NjgzOSwiaWF0IjoxNzU5MDgyODU3LCJleHAiOjE3NjE2NzQ4NTcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yODg4MzI0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.0OWqxaxiPyh-9ci1fUp3yGJDV10R_L4UgENj7E2pmNA)

### A sermon on Revelation 12:7-12, for the Festival of St. Michael and All Angels (observed on the Sixteenth Sunday after Pentecost, September 28, 2025).

The Lord God is our refuge, friends. He is the Rock in whom we trust. Amen.

Maybe you heard: The rapture was supposed to happen last week. Some people expected that Jesus was going to snatch up all true believers into heaven on Tuesday, to protect them from all the terrible things that will take place before the world ends.

This, of course, did not happen. Nor will it happen. There will be no such event; it’s a foolish misrepresentation of biblical teaching, which unfortunately has been so widely spread throughout American Christianity that many assume that if you are a Bible-believing Christian you _must_ believe in the rapture, and if you don’t you’re a Bible-hating pagan.

That’s plain wrong. And as the current church year end, I plan to preach through Second Thessalonians in November. It’s a foundational book for understanding the Bible’s teaching about the end of the world. It’s not a long book; three chapters. We’ll take the first four Sundays in November to read it.

Revelation is probably the first book of the Bible people think of, though, if they want to find out what the Bible says about the world’s last days. And it is about that, but Revelation is at the end of the Bible for a reason. To read Revelation, you need a solid handle on the rest of the Bible. You need to read something like Second Thessalonians (where the apostle Paul more plainly lays out doctrine) to read Revelation’s pictures and visions and understand them.

Revelation is not a step-by-step chronology of the end of the world. Revelation depicts history, from (basically) Pentecost onward, from various angles. Revelation chapters four to eight, for instance, are more of a “God’s-eye-view” of history.

What we’re reading today, this portion of Revelation twelve, comes from a section of the book that looks at history from this angle: _“What will Satan be doing?”_ In that section, the pictures and visions John recounts are more alarming. Beasts of great power oppress humanity and attack the church. Satan, the dragon, rages. But even in this section, which shows Satan exercising his wicked powers to their fullest extent, it’s clear that he loses. Satan loses. The Great Dragon is Thrown Down.

Satan is an angel. Angels, the book of Hebrews tells us, were created to be **“ministering spirits.”** They work for God. We can ask _why_ God made angels, why an omnipotent Creator wants their service, but any answer we propose is speculation. There’s no reason given in the Bible as to why God would use his power to make beings who would carry out his will, rather than simply use his power to by himself do what he wanted done. All we’re told is that God made angels, and they serve him.

Or - at least - some of them do. Some rebelled. The first verse of our reading, Revelation twelve seven: **“War broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.”**

At some point, Satan and some other angels rebelled against God. We have no way of understanding, as humans in this life, what a war between angels would look like. And we don’t really know _why_ Satan rebelled. I would say that the best guess we can make for his motive, based on a few passages of Scripture, was that he found it demeaning to serve humans. John Milton suggested in his epic poem _Paradise Lost_ that Satan thought he could supplant God, or set himself up as equal to God. The Bible doesn’t tell us what his motive was.

Regardless of his motive, the outcome was that he lost. Verse eight, **“he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.”** That long-ago battle is primarily what we can think as Satan being _“cast down.”_ But that’s not the only event we can think of here.

See, after that battle, the book of Job tells us, Job one verse six, **“the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.”** This appearance of Satan before God sets up the action of the book of Job, wherein God allows Satan to test Job with severe trials and losses to let Job’s faith be shown forth.

When Jesus speaks in our Gospel reading of seeing **“Satan fall like lightning from heaven,”** he’s referring not to the fact that he witnessed Satan’s long-ago defeat by the archangel Michael, but to the effect of the Gospel ministry of his seventy-two followers. Through the Gospel, God creates faith. Through faith, we stand righteous in God’s sight. And so when Satan attempts to stand before God and condemn us, by faith, we are justified. And he is cast out of heaven once again. In legal parlance, his case is dismissed with prejudice.

Satan is given a lot of names in our reading. He’s called **“the great dragon.”** In ancient mythologies, across various cultures, “_dragons_” were something more like a great snake. But ancient cultures recognized them as something distinct from snakes. The legends of Alexander the Great’s travels recount encounters with “_dragons_.” In India, his army is warned to avoid disturbing a dragon which dwells in a nearby cave and is worshiped by the locals. The dragon sticks its head and neck out of the cave to hiss at them as they pass, and this portion of its body alone is thirty meters long, with eyes as large as a soldier’s shield. Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s generals, also recounted that when they became lost during a desert crossing, two talking dragons appeared to guide Alexander. So, in these ancient cultures, dragons are depicted as vast creatures, often capable of rational discourse. Most importantly, they are seen as powerful. They appear in the lives of influential people in influential ways.

That’s the cultural background behind Satan being described here as a “_dragon_.” He is a powerful being who seeks to influence the events and history of this world.

He’s also a “_snake_.” Specifically here, he is **“that ancient serpent.”** This is the biblical verse that affirms identifying the snake in the garden of Eden with Satan. See, Genesis never says explicitly that the snake was Satan. But (in fairness to Moses) it wouldn’t have made sense to him to do that, because “_Satan_” is not, technically speaking, a name.

**“Satan”** - another name given to the dragon - is originally a Hebrew word that simply means, “_an_ _enemy_.” When Moses wrote Genesis, “_Satan_” was not being used as a proper name for this particular rebellious angel. Using “_Satan_” in that way comes about later. That doesn’t mean that Satan didn’t exist. It just means that he wasn’t being called “_Satan_.”

Another name he’s given is **“the devil.”** That’s also not exactly a name. It’s a Greek word, _diabolos_. In English, we have the word “diabolical.” “Devil” and “diabolical” come from the same Greek word. In English, “diabolical” means “evil,” more or less. _Diabolos_ is a more specific word. It means “_slanderer_.” A _devil_ in Greek is someone who slanders. They tell lies about others. Or if they tell the truth about someone, they tell it in the worst possible way. A _diabolos,_ a _devil_, questions others’ motives. A devil wants you to think the worst about others.

To be a _devil_, a _diabolos_, breaks the Eighth Commandment. Martin Luther reminds us in the Large Catechism’s explanation of that command, _“God here forbids the detestable, shameful vice of speaking behind a person’s back, to which the devil spurs us on. We are all ourselves so bad that we cannot suffer that any one should say anything bad about us, yet also cannot bear that the best is spoken about others.”_

The word “_devil_” is used to talk about this particular rebellious angel. But the Bible also uses it in places to warn us about the content of our speech. In First Timothy, Paul says that some of the women of Timothy’s church need to be warned against being, according to the NIV, **“malicious talkers.”** The Greek word there is “_devilish_.” Outside the Bible in early Christian writing, the preacher Polycarp wrote in one of his letters that no man could serve in the church who was, likewise, “_devilish_,” given to slander.

The last name that’s given to the dragon is in the second half of verse ten: **“The accuser”** “_Accuser_” is a legal word. In an ancient Greek courtroom, this was sort of a cross between prosecuting attorney and plaintiff. The _accuser_ presents condemning evidence in a courtroom.

Satan, the enemy, is a _devil_, a slanderer. He is also an _accuser_, one who presents real evidence of wrongdoing. And he has real evidence to present. You and I have done what is wrong. We have often been _devilish_. We tell mocking stories about coworkers to belittle them. We send around screenshots of text messages to tip the opinion of our friend group against someone. We recount arguments we had, highlighting the rude thoughtlessness of others and omitting our own poor behavior. Satan sees these things! And he fully intends to present these incidents before God one day to argue that you do not belong with God, but with the great dragon and his angels.

That hope is what animates Satan now. It’s what gets him out of bed in the morning (metaphorically speaking). He wants you to sin. And he is a _dragon_; he is powerful. He is not omniscient, all-knowing, like God. But he has seen a lot of humans over a very long time. He gets what makes us tick. He knows how to tempt you. In human legal terms, we could call what Satan likes to do “_entrapment_.” He tries to engineer situations such that we will sin, so that we will suffer separation from God and punishment for eternity alongside him.

For this reason, we persistently pray that God send his holy angels to protect us from Satan’s attacks. Michael and his angels cast Satan and his angels out of heaven long ago, and they can cast them away from you. He **“was not strong enough”** to resist then, and he is not strong enough now. For that reason, we heard Elisha assure his servant in our first reading, **“Don’t be afraid. Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”** Satan and his angels are outnumbered by the angels of God; Satan and his angels are not stronger than the angels of God.

This is a reason to be _confident_, but not _arrogant_. A lion is not stronger than the iron bars of its cage at the zoo. But stick your hand through the bars, and see what happens. Put yourself in Satan’s path; walk away from the protection of the angels of God; you are inviting your own ruin. To trifle with the great dragon is arrogance.

But you can have _confidence_ despite Satan’s threats. You don’t need to go looking for him for him to attack you. He seeks to do so day and night. Luther wrote in his explanation of the Lord’s Prayer, focusing on the petition **“deliver us from evil,**” that _“the devil is not only a liar, but also a murderer. He constantly seeks our life, and wreaks his anger wherever he can. Therefore there is nothing for us to do upon earth but to pray against this archenemy without ceasing. For unless God preserved us, we would not be safe from him even for an hour.”_

“_Unless_” is the key word there. God does preserve us. He sends his angels to hold back this foe. He has paid for our sins - those sins which Satan would present as evidence for our condemnation - with the death of his Son. Thus our reading reminds us that God’s people overcome Satan **“by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.”**

Overcoming Satan by the blood of the Lamb, that we understand: Christ paid for our sins. But what does it mean that we overcome Satan **“by the word of** _**our**_ **testimony**”?

It means this: That when the devil calls you a devil, and reminds you of the slanders that have come off your untamed tongue and thoughtless fingers, you can say to him, _“Such sins I have indeed committed; but what right have you to speak about them now? For my Lord Jesus Christ has become sin for me, that in him I might become the righteousness of God.”_ Great dragon, you are thrown down! Accuser, the case is closed! Snake, your head is crushed. Thanks be to God, the Lord of the heavenly hosts! Amen.
