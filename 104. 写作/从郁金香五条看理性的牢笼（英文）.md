# Breaking Free from the Cage of Reason: A Look at the TULIP (Five Points of Calvinism)

## Introduction: Common Questions Among Believers

Every believer has probably wrestled with these questions:

**The Contradiction Between God's Omnipotence and Universal Salvation**: If God is all-powerful and full of grace, and Jesus died for human sin on the cross, why haven't all people received salvation? Is God not powerful enough?

**The Problem of Complete Redemption**: If Jesus died for everyone's sins, but not everyone is saved, hasn't part of Jesus' redemption been "wasted"? Doesn't this contradict Jesus' power?

**The Problem of Believers Falling Away**: If Jesus is the mighty shepherd who said he would seek the lost sheep, why do some people start believing but then fall away? Can't Jesus find that one lost sheep? Is he too busy? Doesn't the Bible say he would leave the 99 to find the one that was lost?

To address these questions, different theological systems have developed throughout history. The most famous is the Calvinist perspective known as the "Five Points of Calvinism" or "TULIP."

Let me first explain what these five points mean, then we'll explore them together.

## The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP)

### 1. Total Depravity

Humans are completely corrupt—100% sinners with no remaining goodness or light in their hearts. People cannot seek or choose to believe in God on their own. (Simply put: this opposes "decision prayers"—humans cannot decide to believe in God; faith is 100% God's work because human nature is completely corrupt and cannot choose to believe in God.)

### 2. Unconditional Election

God chose people for salvation before the creation of the world according to his own will, not based on human merit, behavior, or future choices. Whether a person goes to heaven or hell is completely God's will and has nothing to do with humans. (If you're familiar with "double predestination," this is it. Double predestination involves not only God choosing those who will be saved, but also predestining who will ultimately perish. In Calvinism, everyone's final destiny—whether salvation or damnation—was decided by God in eternity past.)

### 3. Limited Atonement (also called Particular Redemption)

Jesus did not die for everyone. Christ's death was effective and specific, accomplishing redemption only for God's chosen people, not universally saving all people without distinction. Christ died only for the elect, and Christ's blood was not wasted (Jesus did not lay down his life for unbelievers).

### 4. Irresistible Grace

People have no ability to reject God. When the Holy Spirit works in the hearts of the chosen, this grace is necessarily effective, causing people to repent and believe. People cannot ultimately resist God's work in their hearts.

### 5. Perseverance of the Saints

This means "once saved, always saved." Those who are truly chosen and saved will necessarily persevere to the end and will not ultimately be lost, because God will preserve them. If someone stops believing or falls away, they were never truly saved to begin with. There's no such thing as true believers falling away—this would contradict God's sovereignty (power).

## Why Do These Questions Arise?

Regardless of your choices above, let's first consider why people ask these questions.

It's because some unavoidable contradictions face every believer: God's attributes contradict each other and cannot be reconciled at the rational level.

God is omnipotent, merciful, and just.

- Because of God's mercy and grace, he desires all people to be saved
- Because of God's power, he should be able to save all people
- The reality is that not all people believe

So if we want to preserve both God's grace and power (sovereignty) at the rational level, we must sacrifice one. Do you choose to preserve the big one or the small one?

## Calvin's Choice: Preserve God's Sovereignty

Calvin chose to preserve God's power (sovereignty), so he proposed the five points above.

You can see that these five points emphasize God's omnipotence—his sovereignty. But preserving God's sovereignty isn't without problems—if God decides everything, then there's no human agency. Then God would be responsible for choosing some people to go to hell, and if a god chooses some people for hell, then he's not good or gracious, right?

But there seems to be no better solution. Omnipotence and grace/mercy/love must be traded off. Calvin chose to sacrifice God's attributes of "grace, mercy, love" to maximize preservation of God's omnipotent attribute.

## Arminius' Opposition

However, some opposed this solution. Dutch theologian Arminius held that:

1. **Not totally depraved** - goodness and light remain, so people can make decisions to follow the Lord. (Believing in the Lord is a personal decision. People can pray decision prayers; goodness remains in human hearts; people decide to follow the Lord.)
    
2. **Not unconditional election** - God chooses based on the faith he foresees this person will have in eternity. (God chooses based on human choices.)
    
3. **Unlimited atonement** - Christ died for all people; those who believe are saved (part of Jesus' blood was wasted).
    
4. **Resistible grace** - People can accept or reject God's grace.
    
5. **Believers can lose salvation** - If they abandon faith, salvation may be lost.
    

In my view, Arminius chose the other side. He preserved God's attributes of "grace, mercy, love" and cut away some of God's omnipotent attribute.

## The Lutheran Perspective: Which Is Greater—Reason or God?

### The Cage of Reason

Both views above fall into the same mistaken premise: "Faith must conform to reason, because not conforming to reason equals being incorrect."

These two solutions both ignore one thing: Why do we have this dilemma? Because it's hard to accept, feels illogical, seems contradictory, doesn't conform to reason.

Reason is like a cage—a cage that must never be broken, and anything that can't fit inside this cage cannot be correct truth. And God's word must be correct truth, so we must stuff it inside. But this cage is too small to contain God...

We value reason so much that we forget what God is.

- God is infinite; we are finite
- God is the helper we hope exists when we're helpless—beyond reason and explanation
- God is a transcendent being who existed before this world
- Before God created the world, did reason exist?

Think about what happens when people face overwhelming difficulties—they naturally cry out to God, hoping for help from a power beyond the natural world. In our deepest moments of need, we instinctively appeal to something transcendent, something beyond our own understanding and control. From this perspective, what's the definition of God? God means a transcendent being by nature, but we want him to conform to reason.

This thinking is somewhat contradictory, isn't it? But let's think about how this seemingly unreasonable demand (demanding God conform to reason) arose. It comes from our idea that correct principles (truth) must conform to reason. The crux of the problem is here: Is this idea correct? Are principles that don't conform to reason necessarily wrong?

At least in natural science, this isn't the case. The foundation of natural science is experimentation, not human reason:

**Experiments are the touchstone for testing hypotheses**

- For example, two balls dropped from the Tower of Pisa showed that heavier objects don't fall faster
- For example, the double-slit experiment showed that light has both particle and wave properties

No matter how hard such experimental results are to accept, we must accept the experimental results. Because we can only understand the natural world through experiments.

Similarly, in the field of theology, what can we rely on to understand God and redemption? When we encounter statements that are hard to accept, what can we turn to for help?

My answer is Scripture. As that children's song goes: "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so."

In understanding God and his redemption, besides God revealing himself to us through revelation, do we have anything else that can serve as a foundation? Is there any more reliable basis than God's word?

### Reason or God—Which Is Greater? Scripture Above Reason

We believe Scripture is the book through which God reveals himself to us. We believe the revelation about God in Scripture. We believe God is omnipotent, full of grace, and completely just. We don't need to prove God's omnipotence, grace, and justice. We believe this because the Bible tells us so.

Therefore, in the matter of salvation that only God can accomplish, if Scripture and reason conflict, we naturally choose to believe Scripture's content. We need to "put a bridle on reason and not let this wild horse run wild." In matters of salvation, reason must submit to God's word.

We believe Scripture is the truth God has revealed to us, fully revealing God's omnipotence, grace, and justice. Scripture says so, so we believe so. But do we need something else to prove that what we believe—God's word revealed to us—is correct and without error? Do we need it? Is God's word sufficient? If it's sufficient, then we don't need to try to prove the truth revealed in Scripture, do we?

Therefore, when Scripture conflicts with our reason, we choose to believe Scripture because it is God's word. In matters of salvation, our reason must submit to God's word; we can't let it randomly crash into truth's boundaries. We need to "put a bridle on reason and not let this wild horse run wild."

Actually, such "conflicts" aren't real conflicts and contradictions—we're just not used to them; they make us uncomfortable. This isn't unique to theology; similar things have happened in natural science and mathematics.

I seem to see this picture: People want to cage a lion in the "cage of reason," but the cage is too small. Either the claws stick out or the tail sticks out. But to fit it in, they must cut off the parts that stick out.

In fact, reason must rely on certain external truths as foundations; only on these foundations can it build reliable systems. In mathematics, these foundations are axiomatic truths; in natural science, these foundations are experimental data; in theology, the external foundation is God's personally revealed redemption.

These external foundations often challenge our rational thinking, making us feel uncomfortable and unadapted. For example, the Tower of Pisa experiment broke conventional understanding of falling objects, and light's wave-particle duality forces us to accept the strange nature that light is both particle and wave. Similarly, many truths in theology clash with our "common sense" because they transcend our conventional thinking frameworks.

Without these truths as foundations, reason cannot construct a self-consistent and reliable system. This is like natural science—without experimental data as support, any theory might become empty speculation. In theology, without God's word as revelation, reason cannot fully understand or explain God's salvation plan.

Therefore, we must admit that reason is not an omnipotent tool; it needs to rely on truths beyond reason as foundations to build reliable cognitive systems.

## Lutheran Views on the Five Points of Calvinism

### 1. Total Depravity

Humans are completely corrupted by original sin and cannot seek God on their own; salvation depends entirely on God's grace.

_"There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."_ (Romans 3:10-12)  
_"Dead in transgressions and sins"_ (Ephesians 2:1)

### 2. Unconditional Election with Important Distinctions

God's election comes entirely from grace, not based on God foreseeing human faith. (This follows from the previous point—humans are completely corrupt, so human belief is 100% God's grace; faith is given by God; humans have no merit.) However, we reject Calvinist "double predestination"—God desires all people to be saved. (As far as I know, the word "election" in Scripture is used exclusively to comfort sorrowful believers and strengthen believers' faith. "Election" has never been used to discuss predestination to salvation versus predestination to damnation.)

_"He wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."_ (1 Timothy 2:4)  
_"Not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."_ (2 Peter 3:9)  
_"Just as he chose us in him before the creation of the world"_ (Ephesians 1:4)

### 3. Universal Atonement

We maintain that Christ died for all humanity; salvation is open to everyone, but only believers receive this gift of salvation. (Jesus' blood appears to be "wasted," but we believe God is omnipotent. Though this seems to suggest God isn't omnipotent, we believe it because this is what Scripture says.)

_"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."_ (1 John 2:2)  
_"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."_ (John 3:16)

### 4. Resistible Grace Paradox

Human will is completely corrupt—human sinful nature rejects grace, but God's grace works in sinners' hearts. The change from unbelief to belief is 100% God's work; if people reject God's grace, it's 100% the result of sin, and people must take responsibility for their sin. (I know this seems illogical. But remember, people once thought two balls of different weights falling simultaneously was also illogical.)

_"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."_ (Ephesians 2:8-9)  
_"Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world."_ (John 3:19)  
_"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them."_ (John 6:44)

### 5. God's Preservation with Warnings

God certainly preserves believers (this is gospel, bringing comfort to fearful and worried believers, and it's also a true promise from God—God preserves us). But if someone abandons faith, salvation may be lost (this is law, bringing warning to believers living carelessly in sin, and this warning has real consequences—the wages of sin is death, and God is just).

We understand these apparent biblical contradictions from the perspective of law and gospel, so we don't emphasize "absolute once saved, always saved." (On similar topics, Scripture has completely opposite descriptions. Sometimes it's law, warning of the dangers of continued sin. Sometimes it's gospel, comforting souls grieving in sin. Both are correct truths. I know this sounds illogical.)

_"To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy."_ (Jude 1:24)  
_"See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God."_ (Hebrews 3:12)  
_"If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned."_ (John 15:6)  
_"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'"_ (Luke 15:4-6)

## Conclusion

Facing the theological contradiction between God's attributes of omnipotence, mercy, and justice and the reality that not all people are saved, Calvin, Arminius, and Luther offered different responses:

**Calvinism** chose to maintain God's supreme sovereignty, preserving the system's rational consistency by limiting salvation's scope, but sacrificing human moral responsibility.

**Arminianism** chose to emphasize human free will and moral responsibility, making God's election respond to human choices, but somewhat limiting God's sovereignty.

**Lutheranism** proposed a third way: refusing to let reason become faith's "cage," accepting paradoxes in biblical revelation. When Scripture tells us God is omnipotent, merciful, and just, while also saying not all people are saved, we don't need to use reason to "correct" this contradiction. Instead, we acknowledge that when finite human reason faces the infinite God, the existence of paradox might be precisely the mark of truth.

Just like light's wave-particle duality in natural science, some truths transcend our familiar frameworks for understanding the world, but this doesn't mean they're wrong. Luther reminds us: Which is greater—reason or God? When they conflict, we choose to believe "for the Bible tells me so," putting a bridle on reason, this wild horse.

We learn God's word, describe it, become familiar with it, and use it. In this respect, natural science is really very similar to theology.

## Appendix: Gödel's Incompleteness of Reason

_The following discussion is very abstract and difficult to understand, but it belongs to the same topic as this article, so I'm including it here. You're welcome to continue reading._

### Background

In the early 20th century, mathematician Hilbert proposed the "formalist program," hoping to establish a complete, consistent mathematical system:

- **Completeness**: All mathematical truths can be proven within the system
- **Consistency**: The system cannot derive mutually contradictory propositions
- **Decidability**: There's a mechanical procedure (algorithm) that can determine whether a proposition holds

Gödel used logic and mathematics to elegantly prove: this dream cannot be realized.

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems (Simplified)

**First Theorem (Incompleteness Theorem I)** In any sufficiently powerful (able to express basic arithmetic), consistent formal system, there will always be propositions that:

- Cannot be proven true or false within that system

In other words: **No self-consistent formal system can contain all mathematical truths.**

**Second Theorem (Incompleteness Theorem II)** An even stronger step: **Any such formal system cannot prove its own consistency.**

If the system can prove it's "definitely not contradictory," then it's actually contradictory.

### Core Idea (Popular Understanding)

Gödel constructed a "self-referential" proposition, similar to: _"This proposition cannot be proven in this system."_

- If the system proves it → contradiction (because it says it can't be proven)
- If the system can't prove it → it's actually true (because indeed it wasn't proven)

Thus we get propositions that are true but unprovable.

### Philosophical and Rational Significance

**Incompleteness of Reason**: If humans rely solely on formal logical systems (symbols, rules, deduction) to grasp all truth, they're destined to hit "boundaries."

**The Gap Between Reason and Truth**: No matter how perfect rational tools are, they cannot completely encompass "truth."

**Critique of Scientism**: Science and logic cannot answer all questions; truth is greater than reason.

### The Tension Between Reason and Truth

Gödel's incompleteness theorem reminds us:

1. Rational systems (logic, mathematics) are limited and cannot self-sufficiently encompass all truth
2. Some "truths" exist that we can intuitively know are true, but cannot be proven within the system

This is like what Scripture says: _"For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."_ (1 Cor 1:25)

Reason is not an omnipotent tool; it's only part of creation, while truth itself transcends reason.

### Impact on "Rationalism"

The Hilbert school hoped to construct a mathematical edifice "completely based on human rational self-consistency," but Gödel proved this goal must fail.

Applied to worldview: If people make reason their ultimate god, they will inevitably hit a wall.

This confirms the Christian faith's concept: human wisdom is limited; to know ultimate truth, we must rely on God's revelation.

### From Faith and Philosophy Perspectives

**Truth Cannot Be Completely Formalized** Gödel's theorem shows: some "truths" don't depend on formal proof but "exist independently."

Analogy: God's existence and the mystery of salvation don't depend on whether our logic can prove them, but exist prior to reason.

**The Necessity of Faith and Revelation** If we rely only on reason, human understanding will always have gaps. But God reveals himself in Christ, allowing people to enter truth through faith.

Gödel himself, though a mathematician, tended to believe in God's existence and even wrote drafts of "proof of God's existence" in his later years.

### Summary in One Sentence

Gödel's incompleteness theorem tells us: **Reason is limited, while truth is infinite.**

Science and logic have their limits; the space beyond reason is precisely where "faith" enters.
